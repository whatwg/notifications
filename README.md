This repository hosts the
[Notifications API Standard](https://notifications.spec.whatwg.org/).

### Pull requests

See the [whatwg/html README](https://github.com/whatwg/html/blob/master/README.md) for the general
guidelines. Note that `source` is `notifications.bs` and "Acknowledgements" is "Acknowledgments"
here (I know). Also, the Notifications API Standard uses
[bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed) to generate `notifications.html`. (Do not worry if
using that tool is too complicated, your pull request does not need to contain the generated HTML.)
